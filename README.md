# <password-generator>

## Description

In this project, I wanted to create a random password generator 
based on the criteria chosen by the user. Prompts ask if
password should contain uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers,
or special symbols, and then generates a unique password for the user.

## Usage

Press the red button to generate password, and then choose desired
characters as prompted by alerts. Random password will appear in
the text box!

## Features
ability to create password with or without lower/uppercase letters,
numbers, or special characters!
